## MVP - An Introduction

**MVP** stands for **M**inimum **V**iable **P**roduct, and in terms of software and product development, describes a process which
attempts to mitigate financial risk by bringing the bare minimal or the essence of an idea to market as soon as possible.

For software products, the MVP development lifetime spans anywhere from a weekend to 30 or 60 days. 

Choice snippets from Wikipedia:

{% blockquote MVP http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product Wikipedia %}
  The minimum viable product (MVP) is the product with the highest return on investment versus risk.
  
  The product is typically deployed to a subset of possible customers, such as early adopters that are thought to be more 
  forgiving, more likely to give feedback, and able to grasp a product vision from an early prototype or marketing information. 
  
  **It is a strategy targeted at avoiding building products that customers do not want.**
{% endblockquote %}

For me, the last quote is the most significant as I have personal experience of this.

## A Personal Story - I Wish I Knew MVC Sooner

Being a software developer puts me in the fortunate position of being able to conceive an idea and execute the entire software 
development process by myself; a one-man-band, if you will. This means I can take an idea, design and develop all the necessary components such as: 
database design, hosting solutions, front-end and back-end code, etc...

This is a skill I took full advantage of in the last two decades, developing nearly a dozen personal projects and many more commercial clients products.
A dozen personal applications sounds prolific; it isn't, considering that a small percentage of 
these were viable. For reference, most notable of these non viable products include:

* [MediaCMS](https://github.com/nazar/MediaCMS) - a media publishing website, enabling media owners to sell images, photos, videos and audio files. **Total Development Time: 12 months**.
* [RecipeTrees](https://github.com/nazar/recipetrees) - a recipe sharing website. **Development Time: 6 months**.
* [DarkFallSage](https://github.com/nazar/DarkFallSage) - a [mapwow](http://mapwow.com) like application but for the Dark Fall MMORPG.**Development Time: 4 months**.
* [Wasters](https://github.com/nazar/wasters) - another [mapwow](http://mapwow.com) like application but for the Fallen Earth MMORPG.**Development Time: 2 months**.
  
I wouldn't call any of the above failures. I didn't suffer financial loss, but time otherwise spent with loved ones, and in every instance, I took the opportunity to:
further hone and refresh my skill sets; and experiment with new technologies, platforms and frameworks.
  
If I were an entrepreneur with no aptitude for software development, instead hiring talent to develop the above, it would 
have been a **disaster** for one key reason: I failed to recognise early in the development process that none of these 
were viable products. 

Instead, **and this is key**, I mistook the lack of product popularity due to lack of features and committed 
more resources adding features. This is especially true for [MediaCMS](https://github.com/nazar/MediaCMS); it took me
a year to realise and accept that the product was a failure.

  
## MVP - A Reintroduction

After MediaCMS I started to realise that I had to spend less time in bringing a product to market to maximise my chances of success, which were increased 
if I were to develop five products in a year instead of just the one.

This, in my mind, is the essence of an MVP: take an idea and spend the least amount of resources to prove its worth. If an idea is a success, then build 
on that success; otherwise be brutally honest and abandon it.

Some Images I Googled that illustrate this:

My advice, based on personal experience working on my own and client's products, are aimed at three different groups:

## The Stakeholder

This is your idea; you own it. It is either unique or a remix/re-iteration/evolution/amalgamation of an existing idea or ideas.

Your role is to establish product viability, be it through: market research; interviews and surveys; or via limited release. Keep in
mind that your resources (i.e. time/money) are ***very*** limited. The initial MVP software development focus should be on 
delivering a working product, with the least amount of features but enough to describe the core essence of the idea.

I have personal experience of stakeholders dwelling on the functional aspect of the product and loosing track of the big picture. In all these instances
the outcome was the same: funds were depleted and development stalled leaving a non-functional product.

### Advice


1. Establish the MVP feature set and spend as much time as possible thinking through product processes and how the product is presented
 to your customers. Access to a UX/UI talent is key at this stage. 

1. As much of the theoretical work should be done before software development begins. Think of the software development process as a run-away train; 
 once the development process starts any deviations from course are time consuming and costly. 

1. Stay on target. The temptation to add features must be kept in check, especially if the development process is moving faster/better than anticipated.
 Although initial development is fast paced, this slows down towards the end, and especially in the last 90% of the development cycle, 
 also known as the [Ninety-ninety rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-ninety_rule). This is real and must be accounted and budgeted for.  
 
1. Concentrate the product on as few platforms as possible. I've seen "MVP"s that are simultaneously developed for the web, iOS and Android
  platforms. Congratulations: you now have three run-away trains!

1. Budget for the un-expected. The software development process will over-run the original estimate despite all efforts.

1. Hire talent that specialises in Agile and in developing MVPs, someone like [Clevertech](http://www.clevertech.biz).


## The Project Manager

You are the middle person between the Stakeholder and the talent that actualises the product. 
You are: Commander William Riker to Jean-Luc Picard; or Darth Vader to Emperor Palpatine.

Your role is two fold:

1. Take the idea from the stakeholder and break it down into its smallest constituents. Each of these will be a single
 deliverable, taking more than a few days to complete. Iterate on this principle until the product is delivered.

1. Keep the Stakeholder in check and focused. Ward against feature creep. The stakeholder is human and we all find 
it difficult to realise we are digging ourselves into a hole. 


### Advice

1. Choose a project management tool that is adequate for
    
1. Keep the Stakeholder informed on a daily basis. 
   
1. Keep your house in order.
 1. Setup a centralised resource to document all technical aspects for a project
