# Minimum Viable Product

{% blockquote Wikipedia Entry for MVP http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product Wikipedia %}
  The minimum viable product (MVP) is the product with the highest return on investment versus risk.
  
  A minimum viable product has just those core features that allow the product to be deployed, and no more.
