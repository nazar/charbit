## MVP - An Introduction

**MVP** stands for **M**inimum **V**iable **P**roduct, and in terms of software and product development, describes a process which
attempts to mitigate financial risk by bringing the bare minimal or the essence of an idea to market as soon as possible.

Choice snippets from Wikipedia:

{% blockquote MVP http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product Wikipedia %}
  The minimum viable product (MVP) is the product with the highest return on investment versus risk.
  
  The product is typically deployed to a subset of possible customers, such as early adopters that are thought to be more 
  forgiving, more likely to give feedback, and able to grasp a product vision from an early prototype or marketing information. 
  
  **It is a strategy targeted at avoiding building products that customers do not want.**
{% endblockquote %}

For me, the last quote is the most significant as I have personal experience of this.

## A Personal Story - I Wish I Knew MVC Sooner

Being a software developer puts me in the enviable position of being able to conceive an idea and execute the entire software 
development process by myself; a one-man-band, if you will. This means I can take an idea, design and develop all necessary components such as: 
database design, hosting solutions, front-end, etc...

This is a skill I took full advantage of in the last two decades, developing nearly a dozen personal ideas into desktop 
and web applications. A dozen applications might sound prolific; it isn't, considering that a small percentage of 
these were viable. For reference, most notable of these non viable products include:

* [MediaCMS](https://github.com/nazar/MediaCMS) - a media publishing website, enabling media owners to sell images, photos, videos and audio files. **Total Development Time: 12 months**.
* [RecipeTrees](https://github.com/nazar/recipetrees) - a recipe sharing website. **Development Time: 6 months**.
* [DarkFallSage](https://github.com/nazar/DarkFallSage) - a [mapwow](http://mapwow.com) like application but for the Dark Fall MMORPG.**Development Time: 4 months**.
* [Wasters](https://github.com/nazar/wasters) - another [mapwow](http://mapwow.com) like application but for the Fallen Earth MMORPG.**Development Time: 2 months**.
  
I wouldn't call any of the above failures. I didn't suffer financial loss, but time otherwise spent with loved ones, and in every instance, I took the opportunity to:
further hone and refresh my skill sets; and experiment with new technologies, platforms and frameworks.
  
If I were an entrepreneur with no aptitude for software development, instead hiring talent to develop the above, it would 
have been a **disaster** for one key reason: I failed to recognise early in the development process that none of these 
were viable products. 

Instead, **and this is key**, I mistook the lack of product popularity due to lack of features and committed 
more resources adding features. This is especially true for [MediaCMS](https://github.com/nazar/MediaCMS); it took me
a year to realise and accept that the product was a failure.

  
## MVP - A Reintroduction

After MediaCMS I started to realise that I had to spend less time in bringing a product to market to maximise my chances of success, which were increased 
if I were to develop five products in a year instead of just one.

This, in my mind, is the essence of an MVP: take an idea and spent the least amount of time and effort to prove its worth. If an idea is a success, then build 
on that success; otherwise be b brutally honest and abandon it.

Some Images I Googled that illustrate this:

My advice, based on personal experience working on my own and client's products, are aimed at three different groups:

### The Stakeholder

This is your idea. You own it. It is either unique or a remix/re-iteration/evolution/amalgamation of an existing idea or ideas.

Your primary role is to establish product viability, be it through market research or via limited release

### The Project Manager

You are the middle person between the idea's parent and the talent that actualises it. 

Your role is two fold:

1. Take the idea from the stakeholder; break it down to  

### The Architect and Developer
