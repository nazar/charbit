## MVP - An Introduction

**MVP** stands for **M**inimum **V**iable **P**roduct, and in terms of software and product development, describes a process which
attempts to mitigate financial risk by bringing the bare minimal or the essence of an idea to market.

Choice snippets from Wikipedia:

{% blockquote MVP http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product Wikipedia %}
  The minimum viable product (MVP) is the product with the highest return on investment versus risk.
  
  The product is typically deployed to a subset of possible customers, such as early adopters that are thought to be more 
  forgiving, more likely to give feedback, and able to grasp a product vision from an early prototype or marketing information. 
  
  **It is a strategy targeted at avoiding building products that customers do not want.**
{% endblockquote %}

For me, the last quote is the most significant as I have personal experience of this.

## A Personal Story - or How I Wish I Knew MVC Sooner

Being a software developer puts me in the enviable position of being able to conceive an idea and execute the entire software 
development by myself; a one-man-band, if you will. This means I can take an idea, design and develop all necessary components such as: 
database design, hosting solutions, front-end, etc...

This is a skill I took full advantage of in the last two decades, developing nearly a dozen personal ideas into desktop 
and web applications. A dozen applications might sound prolific. It isn't. Considering that a very small percentage of 
these products were viable. For reference, most notable of these non viable products include:

* [MediaCMS](https://github.com/nazar/MediaCMS) - a media publishing website, enabling media owners to sell images, photos, videos and audio files. **Total Development Time: 12 months**.
* [RecipeTrees](https://github.com/nazar/recipetrees) - a recipe sharing website. **Total Development Time: 6 months**.
* [DarkFallSage](https://github.com/nazar/DarkFallSage) - a [mapwow](http://mapwow.com) like application but for the Dark Fall MMORPG.**Total Development Time: 6 months**.
* [Wasters](https://github.com/nazar/wasters) - another [mapwow](http://mapwow.com) like application but for the Fallen Earth MMORPG.**Total Development Time: 6 months**.
  
I wouldn't call any of the above failures. I didn't suffer financial loss (only time) and in every instances, I took the opportunity to
further hone and refresh my skill sets.
  
If I were an entrepreneur without software development skills and employing a team to develop the above, this would 
have been a **disaster** for one key reason: I failed to recognise early in the development process that none of these 
were viable products. 

Instead, **and this is the key mistake**, I mistook the lack of product popularity with lack of features and committed 
more of my time adding more and more features. This is especially true for [MediaCMS](https://github.com/nazar/MediaCMS). It took me
a year to realise and accept that the product was a failure. 

Oh how it would have been different if I realised this in weeks rather than months....
