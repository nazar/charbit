## Professional Profile

A senior analyst, software developer and project manager with twenty years
commercial experience developing applications and [MVPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product).


I describe myself as: highly motivated, focused, driven, dedicated, technological liberal and pragmatic.

Since 2010 my focus has been on JavaScript, initially using NodeJS and in the last
three years specialising in front-end frameworks such as [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and
recently [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/).
Currently I am addicted to [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) and ES6 via [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

Along with me previous Ruby on Rails experience, I've produced websites for the following industries:

+ [Geographic Information Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) with Google Maps API and [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/).
+ Commercial media cataloguing and delivery (video, audio and images).
+ Online training and e-learning.
+ Content management systems.
+ Content integration websites that scrape data from Amazon.
+ Facebook Graph API integration using both the JavaScript and server side SDKs.
+ Community based websites where content can be freely edited with full revision tracking.
+ Custom forum and commenting system implementations.
+ Custom Google maps integration with custom tile sets.
+ Complex polymorphic object relation modelling with solutions that encompass BOM (Bill of Material modelling) and DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graph).

I am adept at source control and change management, specifically using Git and the
[Gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) methodology.
